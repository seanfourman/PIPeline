"""Decide whether the browser-header curl retry in 09-web-research.md may run.

The retry exists to get past bot-filtering firewalls on sites whose robots.txt
permits access. It is never used to override a site that has said no.

WebFetch identifies itself as Claude-User and honors robots.txt, so a 403 has
two very different causes: a WAF default on a site whose published policy
allows access, or a site that has actually declined. This tells them apart.

Rules implemented (RFC 9309), deliberately on the cautious side:
  * longest-match wins; on equal specificity Disallow wins
  * a Disallow for either "*" or "Claude-User" blocks the retry
  * blank lines inside a record do not end it (Python's robotparser drops
    rules in that case, which fails open - see tests)
  * one leading UTF-8 byte-order mark is skipped (left in, it hides a first
    "User-agent" line and drops that whole group, which fails open)
  * 404 means no published policy, which is permission
  * any other failure to read robots.txt leaves permission unconfirmed,
    and the retry does not happen - including a User-agent, Allow or
    Disallow line holding U+FFFD, i.e. a byte that is not valid UTF-8
  * only an http or https URL with a host is checked at all; anything else
    is unconfirmed without a request, and curl itself is pinned to http(s)
    on the first hop and on every redirect
  * a caller that sets CACHE_DIR (fetch_page.py --robots-cache) has each
    site's policy kept there for an hour: only a policy read, a 404 or a body
    that passed the checks above, never a failure, and a kept body is checked
    again before it is used. Every path is still decided against the policy;
    only the request for the file is saved. Unset, every check reads it afresh.

Usage:  python3 tools/robots_check.py <url>
Exit 0 = the retry may proceed. Exit 1 = do not retry; go to escalation step 3.
